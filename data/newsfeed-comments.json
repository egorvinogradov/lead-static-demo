As a Mother of boys, I do not want to downsize their success for little girls. I want to bring them into a revised state of being where they will work along side, lift up and celebrate their future wife and daughters as equals, be strong willed and honorable Men who are the partners and protectors of their women because that is what is right, and that is what is sacred. The reptilian male dominated world is fading, the genders (all however many of them there are) should rise together and we should be enlightened as a species."
