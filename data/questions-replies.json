In my experience so far (>2.5 years) there really is no such thing as 'running late' unless you're committed to be in a meeting, and you're a crucial part of it. If you're actually not in the office or available to participate then, that's a problem. But guess what? You'll probably know this is coming at least a half hour before it happens. Ping the relevant people on the meeting, say 'Hey I completely whiffed on this one -- I'm not going to make it. Can we reschedule?'",
